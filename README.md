# LearningOOPWithPharo

This repository contains the sources of the book Learning Object-Oriented Programming and Design with Pharo by S. Ducasse. 
It is a follow up of Botincs: Learning programming with Squeak. But its contents is far more advanced and fun :).

The book is automatically built and available at:

Since I'm not a native english speaker, I appreciate pull requests that help me to get the material in better form.

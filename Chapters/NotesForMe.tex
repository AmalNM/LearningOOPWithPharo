May be we should have a simple syntax chapter


	
	


May be we should explain a bit variable

	x (store) := x (value)
	
	x := y 
	x will point the value pointed by y. 
	

We could use BotMiner to implement the follower chapters and reuse that.

May be at the end of the book: class are objects too.

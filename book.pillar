!!!A word of presentation

I started to write this book back in 1998 when I wrote around 900 pages for the pre sequel to  "Learning Programming with Robots". Apparently I needed to write to understand what I wanted to explain and how. From this I extracted Learning Programming with Robots. For me,  Learning Programming with Robots was a book to teach simple concepts such as variables, loops, procedures and to help people to teach kids how to program. Now I got really frustrated because to be understable by everyone I had to remove what I like: Object-Oriented Programming. Once I met Harald Wertz (which gave me nice ideas) and he asked why I focused on procedural thinking and that I should better teach Object-Oriented Programming. And he was right. 
In fact in was my original objective but I was exhausted after my first attempt.

Now nearly ten years after, I'm ready to write a book to start with object-oriented programming. I hope that you will enjoy it 
as much as I did - even if writing a book for me is a really long and daunting task. 

! Getting started

${inputFile:Chapters/PlayingWithTurtles/PlayingWithTurtles.pillar}$
Here I want the reader to 
- create a turtle
- send messages
- create a method
- send message
- create two turtles

Note sure since it depends on morphic!!! May be just copying what is in JoeTheBox


To the same with Counter
- create a counter
- send messages
- create a method
- create another counter

${inputFile:Chapters/SyntaxNutshell/SyntaxNutshell.pillar}$


With loops and arrays
Then some little exercises 
	Euler kind of 
!! A look at recursion (using Turtle and graphics so what out!)
		MyBooks/botsinc/BookTwo/BotIntro/
		
		

!! Fun with blocks  (using Turtle and graphics so what out!)
		MyBooks/botsinc/BookTwo/Collections/Bloc
	
!! Intro to collection (should find something else)
	MyBooks/botsinc/BookTwo/Collections/IntroCollection	
	
!! Fun with Teapot



! Objects	

${inputFile:Chapters/JoeTheBox/JoeTheBox.pillar}$

${inputFile:Chapters/ObjectsAndClasses/ObjectsAndClasses.pillar}$

${inputFile:Chapters/Converter/Converter.pillar}$

${inputFile:Chapters/Wallet/Wallet.pillar}$

!! Inspector

!!Debugger
- May be before	
- MyBooks/botsinc/BookTwo/Debugger/

${inputFile:Chapters/SimpleLAN/SimpleLANDefinition.pillar}$

!! Inheritance (ok but not graphic)

!! LAN More chapter (ok)

!! Captcha (ok)

! Projects : LSystem (Graphics so let us stop)

Lindermayer systems, also called ''L-Systems'', have been developed
by biology theorists to understand and simulate the growth of plants
cite|Pruz90a. In the following chapters we propose you to implement
different L-Systems from a minimalist to elaborate
ones. Chapter ch:lsystem presents the simplest possible
L-Systems, i.e., L-System composed by one single rule.
Chapter ch:lsystem2 presents an object-oriented model of
L-System that alleviate the limits of the previous implementation.
Chapter ch:plant defines a new class of turtle that allows one
to model plants with the L-Systems defined previously. Finally,
Chapter ch:parametric introduces Parametric L-Systems that
allows one to express more powerful L-Systems. This chapter shows in
particular how inheritance can be used to reuse class already defined.

! Projects - Others

!! Tamagoshi (graphics so let us stop)

!! QRCode looks fun

!! Game Of Life (may be with a textual version)
with conditionals and polymorphism

${inputFile:Chapters/PaperStoneScissor/PaperStoneScissor.pillar}$

!! TinyChat? (yes)







! Project: Path-finder (it is graphical so out or should get a textual version)

! Advanced topics? 

!! Classes are objects too

May be at the end of the book: class are objects too.
